# Contributing to ComfyStudio

Thanks for contributing.

## Before You Start

- Read `README.md` for setup and product context.
- Review `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` if your change affects packaging, workflows, docs, or release behavior.
- Keep changes focused. Small, reviewable pull requests are preferred over large mixed changes.

## Development Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run electron:dev
```

Helpful commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm run starter-pack:build
```

## Workflow-Related Changes

If you add or change a built-in workflow:

1. Update `src/config/workflowRegistry.js`.
2. Update `src/config/workflowDependencyPacks.js`.
3. Update any Generate UI labels or behavior that depend on the workflow.
4. Run `npm run starter-pack:build`.
5. Review the generated files under `docs/workflow-starter-pack/`.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Explain the user problem first, then the implementation.
- Include screenshots or short videos for UI changes when possible.
- Mention any platform-specific testing you performed.
- Call out follow-up work or known limitations clearly.

## Quality Bar

Before opening a PR, please:

- Run `npm run build`.
- Smoke-test the area you changed.
- Avoid committing secrets, tokens, private media, or local settings files.
- Update docs when behavior, setup, or onboarding changes.

## Product Guardrails

Unless the maintainers explicitly decide otherwise, keep these product decisions intact:

- ComfyUI is local-only by default.
- LM Studio integration is local-only.
- Generate dependency preflight should stay enabled.
- Starter Pack docs remain the supported setup bridge for advanced ComfyUI users.
