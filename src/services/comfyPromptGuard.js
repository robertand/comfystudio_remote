/**
 * Shared registry of ComfyUI prompt IDs that ComfyStudio has already
 * claimed responsibility for.
 *
 * The GenerateWorkspace owns the "managed workflow" path: it queues a
 * prompt, polls history, and imports the result into the project's
 * `Generated/` folder via `saveGenerationResult`. Meanwhile the new
 * ComfyUI-tab auto-import service listens for eligible unmanaged prompts and
 * imports outputs into `Imported from ComfyUI/` when they were observed through
 * the embedded ComfyUI tab.
 *
 * To prevent the same generation from being imported twice (once via
 * each path), GenerateWorkspace registers every prompt ID it queues in
 * this guard. The auto-import bridge checks the guard and skips any
 * prompt already claimed by the managed pipeline.
 *
 * The registry is in-memory only (recycles on app reload), which is
 * fine because ComfyUI's own history is bounded and we only care about
 * prompts that are currently in-flight or recently finished.
